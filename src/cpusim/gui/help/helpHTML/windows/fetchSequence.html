<P><FONT FACE="Palantino">The fetch sequence dialog box (see Figure 22) lists on the left side
    (under &quot;implementation&quot;) the current sequence of microinstructions forming the
    <A HREF="../specifications/fetchSequence.html">fetch sequence</A>.</FONT></P>

    <BR>Figure 22. The fetch sequence dialog.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palantino">If you wish to delete one of the microinstructions from the sequence,
    delete it by dragging it out from Fetch Sequence Implementation. If you wish
    to insert a new microinstruction in the sequence, drag the microinstruction you want from
    the list in the right part of the dialog box into the dialog box. To reorder the
    microinstructions in the fetch sequence, just drag them up or down in the list on the
    left side of the dialog box.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">At the bottom of the list of all microinstructions on the right (not shown in Figure 21),
    there is a microinstruction named &quot;Comment&quot;. When executed, this microinstruction does nothing.
    Instead, this microinstruction plays the role of a comment in the fetch sequence's implementation.
    To add a Comment micro to the fetch sequence, drag it into the dialog box.
    A new Comment microinstruction is added to the implementation. You can now edit the comment in the
    implementation list by double-clicking it (or pressing F2). Comments are colored gray and use an italics
    font to distinguish them from regular microinstructions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">Note: Every fetch sequence needs a Decode microinstruction in its implementation.
    The Decode microinstruction causes CPU Sim to decode the fetched instruction and begin executing the
    microinstructions in its execute sequence.</FONT></P>
