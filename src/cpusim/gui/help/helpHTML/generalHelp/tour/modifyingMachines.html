		<FONT FACE="Palatino">While you are in the process of editing
			an existing machine, you may find it frustrating in that you will not
			be allowed to change some parameters because of the uses to which
			they are currently being put. For example, you are not allowed to
			delete a register if one of its bits is being used as a condition
			bit. As another example, you cannot reduce the width of a register if
			that register is the source of a transfer microinstruction that
			transfers all the register’s bits.</FONT>
	</P>
	<P class="p2">
		<FONT FACE="Palatino">To get around these problems, start by
			adding any new components (registers, register arrays, condition
			bits, and RAMs) you want. That is, first create new registers and
			other components without deleting any of the old ones. After this is
			done, you can adjust the microinstructions to use these new
			components instead of the old ones. Only after all this has been done
			should you delete any of the old components.</FONT>
	</P>
	<P class="p2">
		<FONT FACE="Palatino">Once this task has been completed, you
			can change the names of the new components or instructions to the
			names used by the old components if you wish. This will create no
			problems because CPU Sim uses the names of hardware items and
			microinstructions only for display purposes. </FONT>
	</P>
	<P class="p2">
		<FONT FACE="Palatino">Note: If you want to create a machine
			that is a modification of an existing machine, create a copy of the
			existing machine by choosing "Save machine as…" from the <B>File</B>
			menu and typing in a new name for the file, and then modify the copy
			that is stored in the new file.

	<P class="p2">
		<FONT FACE="Palatino">CPU Sim does not allow you to create a
			new machine by cutting and pasting components from an existing
			machine.</FONT>
	</P>
	<P class="p2" FACE="Palatino">
		One final note: A common mistake is made when editing
		microinstructions. A microinstruction might be used in several machine
		instructions and the fetch sequence. If you modify the
		microinstruction, the modification will be used wherever the
		microinstruction appears. If you want to modify the microinstruction
		only for new uses, then you need to create a new microinstruction for
		those uses instead. The easiest way is to duplicate the existing
		microinstruction in the <a href="../windows/microinstructions.html">Microinstructions
			Dialog</a>.
