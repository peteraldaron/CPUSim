<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">A machine instruction consists of one or more bits, up to a maximum of 64 bits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Format</FONT></I></B></FONT></p>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">The user specifies the format of the instruction by specifying a list of fields for the
    instruction. Each <A HREF="fields.html">field</A> corresponds to a certain number of bits of the instruction. The
    first field stores the opcode of the instruction. The machine uses the opcode to determine which instruction it is.
    The remaining fields include the operands of the instruction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">For a very simple example, consider a 16-bit instruction named "load" with format &quot;op reg
    addr&quot;, where &quot;op&quot; is a 4-bit field, &quot;reg&quot; is a 2-bit operand field, and &quot;addr&quot; is
    a 10-bit operand field. When the user wants to include this instruction in an assembly language program, the user
    must type in the program the name of the instruction and 2 operands, each consisting of a symbol or number. For this
    example, a legal assembly language instruction is "load 1 96".</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">There are many options regarding the format of the instruction. For example, you can include
    0-bit fields, which are just used as punctuation in the assembly language instruction. For example, a &quot;loadr&quot;
    instruction might have a format &quot;op reg delta[reg]&quot;, which contains six fields. Here &quot;op&quot; might
    be a 4-bit field as before, &quot;reg&quot; is a 2-bit field, &quot;delta&quot; is an 8-bit field, and &quot;[&quot;
    and &quot;]&quot; are 0-bit fields. To include this instruction in an assembly language program, you could write
    &quot;loadr 1 -3[2]&quot;. Note that you don't supply values for the 0-bit fields and instead the names of those
    fields are used as punctuation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">You can also specify some fields as optional, which means that you need not include a value for
    that field in assembly language programs. In that case, a default value is used for the field. Similarly, you can
    specify some fields to be ignored, which means that you never specify a value for that field in assembly language
    programs and instead a default value is always used.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">Furthermore, you can specify whether the address of the instruction or its successor should be
    subtracted from the value of the field before it is assembled into machine language. Such subtractions are useful
    for pc-relative addressing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">Finally, you can specify a range of legal values for each field. In particular, you can say
    that the field only takes positive integers as values or that it can take signed values. You can also specify
    particular values as the only legal ones. In that case, you need to supply a name for each of those values and then
    use those names in assembly language programs when supplying a value for the field.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Execute sequence</FONT></I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino">Each machine instruction also specifies a list of microinstructions that form the
    implementation of the machine instruction and that are executed when the machine instruction is to be executed. This
    microinstruction list is called the "execute sequence" of the instruction. Every execute sequence should contain an
    <A HREF="micros/end.html">End microinstruction</A>, which causes the machine to stop executing the current execution
    sequence and start executing the <A HREF="fetchSequence.html">fetch sequence</A>, and so cause the start of a new
    machine cycle.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Palatino"><B><I>Parameters:</I></B></FONT>
<DIR><B>opcode:</B> a non-negative integer that fits in the
    first field of the instruction.
    <P><FONT FACE="Palatino"><B>format:</B> a list of 1 or more field names. The sum of the number of bits corresponding
        to the fields must be at most 64.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT FACE="Palatino"><B>implementation:</B> a list of microinstructions that form the execute sequence of the
