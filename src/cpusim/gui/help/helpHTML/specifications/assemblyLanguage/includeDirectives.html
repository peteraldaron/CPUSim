<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>An <I>Include</I> directive is a pseudoinstruction used for temporarily inserting the text from
    one file into the text of another file just before assembly. The pseudoinstruction has the following parts: </P>

    <P>
    <DD><b><I>label:</I> .include <I>text-file-name comment </I></b></DD>
    <P>The word ".include" and the text file name must be included, but the comment and the label are optional. The text
        file name must be a string of 1 or more characters surrounded by double quotes or chevron quotes. For example,
        suppose a file <I> F</I> contains the Include directive:</P></FONT>
<PRE>
	.include "W1-0.h"
</PRE>
<P><font face="Palatino">Then, at the point in <I>F</I> at which the Include directive appears, the contents of file
    "W1-0.h" are temporarily inserted for the purpose of assembly. The quoted part of the Include directive must be the
    pathname of the file to be inserted. This pathname is relative to the file <I>F</I>. For example, the Include
    directive above assumes that the file "W1-0.h" is in the same directory as <I>F</I>. If the file "W1-0.h" is in a
    subdirectory called "defs", for example, then the include directive should say:</font></P>
<PRE>
	.include "defs/W1-0.h"
</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>If the file "W1-0.h" is in the parent directory of <I>F</I>, then the Include directive should
    say:</P></FONT>
<PRE>
	.include "../W1-0.h"
</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>If the file <I>F</I> contains the Include directive:
    <PRE>	.include &lt;W1-0.h&gt;</PRE>
    then CPU Sim will search for the file W1-0.h relative to the directory containing the current machine (that is, the
    .cpu file containing the current machine) instead of relative to the directory containing <I>F</I>.<P></P></FONT>
