        FACE="Palatino"><P>The word ".data" signifies a pseudo-instruction in assembly language. It provides a way for
    the user to insert specific numerical values in specific locations in the assembled code. The pseudoinstruction has
    the following parts:</FONT>
<DIR><FONT FACE="Palatino">
    <B><I>label: </I>.data<I> operands comment</I></B></FONT></DIR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">

    <P>The word ".data" and the operands must be included, but the comment and the label are optional. The label can be
        used as an operand in assembly language statements to refer to the first address of the data that is being
        specified. The pseudoinstruction is terminated by the newline character.</P>

    <P>The first operand must have a positive numerical value <I>n</I> that indicates the number of memory cells of data
        that are being given specific values. </P>

    <P> This operand is followed by one of the following:</FONT>
<UL>
    <li><font face="Palatino">one long value that will be stored using the given number of cells in big-endian
        notation.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Palatino">an integer indicating the number of cells that are to be used to store each data value,
        followed by a bracketed list of the values to be stored. Therefore the number of values in the bracketed list
        times the number of cells per value (specified in the second operand) must equal the total number of cells
        (specified in the first operand). The list items are optionally separated by commas.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Palatino">a bracketed list of values whose length is equal to the number of cells specified in the
        first operand. These values are optionally separated by commas. Note that this case is just a special case of
        the preceding case in which the number of cells per value is omitted and is implicitly assumed to be 1
        cell.</font></li>
</ul>
<P><font face="Palatino">If any of the numbers are negative integers, they are stored in 2's complement form. Note that
    the values can any legal literal value as specified in the <A HREF="syntax.html">assembly language
        syntax</A>.</font></P>
<FONT FACE="Palatino"><P>For examples, consider the following pseudoinstructions:</P>
<PRE>
	.data 5 0             ; fills 5 cells with 0's
	.data 5 [0,0,0,0,0]   ; fills 5 cells with 0's
	.data 5 1 [0,0,0,0,0] ; fills 5 cells with 0's
	.data 5 5 [0]         ; fills 5 cells with 0's
	.data 5 -1            ; fills 5 cells with all 1 bits (the 2's complement representation of -1)
	.data 5 [1,2,3,4,5]   ; fills 5 cells with the five values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	.data 6 2 [4 2 7]     ; fills 6 cells with the three values 4, 2, 7, each using two cells.
