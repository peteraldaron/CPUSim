    <P> The following context free grammar (CFG) gives the syntax of legal assembly language programs. The start symbol
        for the CFG is Program. EOL is an end-of-line token and EOF indicates the end of the file. Square brackets
        indicates an optional item. Items in parentheses followed by "*" indicate 0 or more copies of those items. Items
        in parentheses followed by "+" indicate 1 or more copies of those items. Terminal symbols are displayed in bold
        and are surrounded by quotes. Terminal symbols are case sensitive. A range of characters are indicated by the
        first character of the range and the last character separated by a dash. For example, the small alphabetical
        letters would be indicated by "a-z". All characters in an assembly language program must be ASCII characters.

    <P>Note: In this grammar, we assume that the character starting a comment is a semicolon (;), the character ending a
        label is a colon (:), and the character beginning all pseudoinstructions is a period (.). Users can specify
        other characters to play those three roles in the <A HREF="../../windows/preferences.html">Preferences
            Dialog</A>.</P></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Palatino">
    <P>Here is a summary of the parts of an assembly language program. The basic building
        blocks consist of the following items.</P>

    <P></FONT>
<DD><font face="Palatino">A <I>literal</I> is one of the following: <BR>
    <DL>
        <DD>(a) a decimal integer, <BR>(b) a hexadecimal integer (denoted by the prefix "0x" or "-0x" followed by one or
            more of the characters 0-9, a-f, A-F), <BR>(c) a binary integer (denoted by the prefix "0b" or "-0b"
            followed by one or more 0's or 1's), <BR>(d) a single character surrounded by single quotes. <BR> Literals
            other than single-quoted characters can have an optional plus or minus sign in front. No commas or decimal
            points are allowed in literals. In the case of the single-quoted character, the value of the literal is the
            ASCII value of the character.
    </DL>
</font>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>string</I> is any sequence of characters surrounded by double quotes, such as "abcde",
        or surrounded by chevrons, as in &lt;abcde&gt;. Note that the sequence of characters inside the quotes cannot
        include the double-quote character, the characters inside the chevrons cannot include a chevron, and a string
        cannot contain the EOL character.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>symbol</I> consists of a sequence of one or more characters, These characters include
        all letters a-z and A-Z, the digits 0-9, and the set of punctuation characters specified by the user in the <A
                HREF="../../windows/preferences.html">Preferences Dialog</A>. Any character can start a symbol except a
        digit, a plus sign followed by a digit, or a minus sign followed by a digit, since the parser will parse a
        number instead of a symbol in those three cases. CPU Sim distinguishes between upper and lower case letters;
        hence, "Data" and "data" are considered different symbols.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>label</I> is a symbol followed immediately by a colon. The colon is just a separator
        and is not considered part of the label. The label and colon pair is an optional feature on every line of
        assembly language programs including those lines that are otherwise blank or contain only comments. In the
        latter two cases, the assembler will treat the label as if it referred to the next regular instruction or data
        pseudoinstruction. Labels can be used as operands in statements.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>comment</I> is any sequence of characters preceded by a semicolon ";" and ending at
        the end of the line. Any line of a program can contain a comment. Blank lines and lines containing only comments
        are also allowed in assembly language programs, and are ignored by the assembler. When the program is assembled,
        regular instructions and data pseudoinstructions, including the comments on the ends of the lines, are saved and
        appear after each line of the assembled program in the Comments column of the <A HREF="../../menus/view.html">RAM
            window</A> into which the assembled program is loaded. However, remember that blank lines or lines with only
        comments are discarded when the program gets assembled.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino">A <I>program</I> consists of two parts. The first part contains any number of EQU
        declarations, include directives, and macro definitions in any order. The second part contains any number of
        regular instructions and data pseudoinstructions, one per line.</font></P>

    <P><font face="Palatino"> Note: To separate tokens in assembly language programs that the assembler would otherwise
        treat as one token, use one or more spaces or tab characters.</font></P>
