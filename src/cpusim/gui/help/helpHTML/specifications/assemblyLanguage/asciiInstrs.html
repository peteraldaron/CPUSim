        FACE="Palatino"><P>The word ".ascii" signifies a pseudo-instruction in assembly language. It provides a way for
    the user to insert specific character values in specific locations in the assembled code. The pseudoinstruction has
    the following parts:</FONT>
<DIR><FONT FACE="Palatino">
    <B><I>label: </I>.ascii <I>string comment</I></B></FONT></DIR>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">

    <P>The word ".ascii" and the string must be included, but the comment and the label are optional. The label can be
        used as an operand in assembly language statements to refer to the first address of the data that is being
        specified. The pseudoinstruction is terminated by the end-of-line character.</P>

    <P>The operand must be a string of 0 or more characters surrounded by double quotes. The string cannot include the
        end-of-line or double-quote characters:</P></FONT><PRE>
	.ascii  "abcde"   ; legal
	.ascii  "abc"de"  ; illegal--contains a double quote character.

</PRE>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">The effect of including an Ascii pseudoinstruction in your program is that the assembler inserts
    the ASCII numeric value of each of the characters in the string into the program at the point where the Ascii
    pseudoinstruction appears. So the first example pseudoinstruction above will be assembled into 5 bytes containing
    the 5 ASCII numeric values for the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'.</FONT>
